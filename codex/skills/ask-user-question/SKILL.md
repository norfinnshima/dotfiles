description: Run a structured interview using the AskUserQuestion tool to gather requirements one question at a time. Use when the user says "interview me", "ask me questions about", "use the ask user skill", "use your interview skill", or when requirements are ambiguous and need a guided, option-based questionnaire before proceeding.

# Ask User Question

## Overview

Use a structured interview to collect missing context before planning or executing work.
Ask informed, option-based questions with clear tradeoffs, and wait for answers before proceeding.

## Interview Workflow

1. Explore before asking.
Inspect the codebase and existing patterns.
Note constraints, conventions, and likely decision points.

2. Identify critical decisions.
Focus on choices that impact architecture, scope, or rework risk.
Skip implementation details until direction is clear.

3. Design structured questions.
Ask one question at a time by default.
Provide 2-4 mutually exclusive options with tradeoffs.
Lead with a recommended option based on discovery.

4. Ask and wait.
Use the AskUserQuestion tool if available.
Do not proceed until the user answers or declines.

5. Iterate.
If answers create new unknowns, ask the next question.
When clarity is sufficient, move to planning/execution.

## Question Design Rules

Keep question headers <= 12 chars.
Make options concrete and actionable, not open-ended.
Explain why each option fits and the tradeoffs.
Avoid asking blind; every question must be grounded in discovery.
Prefer single-question turns unless batching is required.

## AskUserQuestion Tool Usage

Use this structure:

Question:

text: specific question with context
header: short tag, max 12 chars
options: 2-4 items, each with label + tradeoff description
multiSelect: false unless multiple options can legitimately apply

If the tool is unavailable, present the same structure in markdown and ask the user to reply with the option label or "Other".

## Example Prompts That Trigger This Skill

- "Interview me about this project."
- "Ask me questions about the requirements."
- "Use the ask user skill."
- "Use your interview skill."
